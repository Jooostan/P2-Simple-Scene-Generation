Title: Firefly Forest

Description: A scene generator using starter code from
- https://github.com/julinas/p2-simple-scene-starter
The page generates a random amount of fireflies along with a random amount
of foreground and background trees within set amounts.

Randomness: I used randomness to create the seemingly random movement of the
fireflies. I also used randomness to determine the amount of fireflies that
are generated along with amount of trees and x positions of the different
trees. 

Reactivity: I used the mouse position to create a parallax affect with the
trees and the shrubs that are in the scene. I also changed the mouse cursor
to disappear and instead show a star. Lastly, on click, the scene gets
refreshed to generate a new scene.

Artist Statement: I was trying to replicate an image that I found online of
fireflies within a forest. I strugged to replicate the tree branches so
instead I tried to make up for it with the shrub up front along with the
different layers of trees. Also with the fireflies I struggled to make their
placement more dispursed in the scene, resulting in a slight clump of
fireflies.
